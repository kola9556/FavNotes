        more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the
        cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of
        Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
        very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
        amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since
        the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
        Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
        accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. Where can I get
        some? There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
        suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
        even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
        sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
        generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the
        first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined
        with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
        The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore a
